Recent studies using animal models have revealed that muscle fatigue induced by potassium disturbances is exacerbated with lowered glycogen levels, i.e., potassium-glycogen interaction. It is likely that reduced muscle glycogen during exercise decrease the energy availability for Na+/K+-ATPase, exacerbating disturbances in potassium and muscle contractility. However, this interaction has only been studied in isolated muscle preparations. My PhD thesis aims to investigate the relationship between potassium/muscle excitability and glycogen in human exercise performance and whether this differs between females and males.
