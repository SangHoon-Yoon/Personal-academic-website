  abstract = {We compared the minute-by-minute muscle activity and oxygenation responses to a repetitive arm motion-induced fatiguing task between the sexes, in order to address the literature gap on these time-dependent fatigue responses. Twenty-six (thirteen females) healthy adults performed a repetitive pointing task (RPT) with the arm moving forward/backward at shoulder height until reaching 8/10 (Borg CR10) for neck/shoulder perceived exertion (RPE). Neck/shoulder RPE, oxygenation and electromyography were recorded every minute and compared between first and second half of the task, and between the sexes. Greater changes in oxygen supply and activation amplitude occurred during the second half of the task. Despite similar time to fatigue-terminal (p {$>$} .05), females showed greater Anterior Deltoid activation amplitude at all time points than males, and only the males showed increases in Anterior and Posterior Deltoid activation amplitudes. In females, Middle (ρ = -.34, p = .04) and Posterior (ρ = -.44, p = .01) Deltoid amplitudes were negatively correlated with perceived exertion during the first half of the task. Results suggest that females’ reduced modulation of Anterior Deltoid activation amplitude may reflect a sub-optimal fatigue-mitigation mechanism compared to males and may help explain their greater susceptibility to neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders.     Novelty bullets  • Despite similar fatigability and trapezius oxygenation, females showed greater deltoid activation throughout the task  • Deltoid activation increased in males but not in females  • The results support the important role of the deltoid in sex-specific neck/shoulder injury mechanisms},
