abstract: Active computer workstations may help reduce workplace sedentarism. However,
  their impact on the upper limb musculoskeletal system is unknown. Subjects participated
  in two 60-min computer laptop-based Bike-and-Type sessions at different cycling
  intensities (LOW, HIGH). Upper trapezius and wrist extensor muscle blood flow, sensitivity
  and pain thresholds, and typing performance were measured intermittently. Neck/shoulder
  discomfort increased over time (p < 0.001), and was higher in the HIGH intensity
  (p = 0.036). Blood flow to the trapezius (p = 0.041)and wrist (p = 0.021)muscles
  were higher during HIGH, and wrist blood flow increased over time (p = 0.01). Trapezius
  sensitivity threshold significantly decreased over time (p = 0.003). There were
  no effects on pressure pain thresholds (interaction p = 0.091). Average typing speed
  was greater during HIGH (p = 0.046)and increased over time (p < 0.001). Time spent
  biking while typing effectively improved performance, which may facilitate muscle
  regeneration, although effects depend on biking intensity.
