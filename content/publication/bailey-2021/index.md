abstract: In repetitive upper limb activities, variability of muscle activity (a feature
  of motor variability) is linked to upper limb fatigability. Prior studies suggest
  that the variability response may change with age and could be related to the oxygen
  saturation of hemoglobin within the muscle. We determined, in female adults, how
  age affects adjustments in movement-to-movement variability of electromyograph (EMG)
  amplitude (RMS), oxygenation, and thickness with fatigue, and explored how these
  responses were related. Fifteen young (23.3 ± 3.1 years) and ten older (62.8 ± 6.9
  years) females completed repeated trials of low-load, isokinetic, concentric/eccentric
  elbow flexion until maximal torque ≤ 70% of baseline. Movement-to-movement variability
  of EMG RMS in concentric phases of movement was quantified by the coefficient of
  variation (EMG CV), and muscle oxygenation and thickness (MTH) were quantified using
  near-infrared spectroscopy, and B-mode ultrasonography. Age*Time and Spearman $h̊o$
  analyses were conducted. Age did not affect fatigability or Time-related changes
  in muscular measures (p > 0.05). Biceps brachii and brachialis EMG CV decreased,
  biceps brachii HbO2 decreased and did not fully recover, and biceps brachii and
  brachialis MTH increased. Higher initial brachialis EMG CV was related to less blunted
  oxygenation in young females (p = 0.021). Oxygenation responses were related to
  altered anterior deltoid EMG CV in young females but altered biceps brachii and
  brachialis EMG CV in older females. Age was not associated with changes in EMG CV,
  oxygenation, or thickness at similar performance fatigability in the concentric/eccentric
  elbow flexion task studied. Adjustments in biceps brachii oxygenation were linked
  to changes in EMG CV more local to the site of fatigue with older age.
