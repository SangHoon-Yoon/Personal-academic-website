Cycling workstation may be a novel solution to counteract the sedentarism in the office environment. The objectives of this project were to examine the effects of: 1) pedaling intensity (25% vs 40% heart rate reserve) and 2) biological sex (male vs female). The outcome measures included typing performance, neck/shoulder muscle activity, blood flow, sensitivity, and discomfort. In brief, we found that males and females respond differently to the different pedaling intensities. For more details, please refer to studies below:
