Female workers are at a greater risk for neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders. The objective of this project was to compare repetitive task-induced changes in muscular parameters between males and females. The outcome measures included muscle activity (via EMG), trapezius oxygenation (via NIRS), and muscle swelling (via ultrasonography). We found that females showed comparable fatigaiblity, oxygenation and majority EMG responses as males; however, females showed greater anterior deltoid activation and an absence of deltoid activation modulation with fatigue.
